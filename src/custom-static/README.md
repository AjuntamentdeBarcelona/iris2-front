Use this folder for overriding statics. For example, place your logo.jpg or logo-ajuntament.jpg, they will be replaced right after the build.

For every asset in the static folder, you can create one with the same subpath in order to override it.

For setting custom styles you can override [_customs.scss](src/assets/css/ajuntament/_customs.scss) content.
